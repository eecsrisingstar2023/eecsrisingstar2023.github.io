There are a lot of theoretical works trying to analyze these phenomena, while the high level idea is still missing: it is unclear when and why these phenomena occur. In this talk, I will show that these phenomena are actually various tips of the same iceberg. They occur when the objective function of optimization has some good regularity. This regularity, together with the effect of large learning rate on guiding gradient descent from sharp regions to flatter ones, leads to the control of the largest eigenvalue of Hessian, i.e., sharpness, along the GD trajectory, which results in various phenomena. This result is based on the nontrivial convergence analysis under large learning rate on a family of nonconvex functions of various regularities without Lipschitz gradient which is usually a default assumption in nonconvex optimization. In addition, it contains the first non-asymptotic result on the rate of convergence in this circumstance. Neural network experiments will also be presented to validate this result. </p><h3 id="eligibility"><b>Bio:</b></h3><p>Yuqing Wang is a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Molei Tao.
