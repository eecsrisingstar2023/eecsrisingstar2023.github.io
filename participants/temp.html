Specifically, I formulate the privacy challenge in twofold. First, compared with traditional clinical computer systems, mobile health systems encounter a much larger attack surface due to their inherent high accessibility. Round-the-clock data collection in mobile health systems is always at odds with privacy preservation. Second, mobile health data are intrinsically heterogeneous and continuously streaming, which poses a challenge in harmonizing the privacy protection requirements across various data formalities and dynamics.

To address these privacy-preserving challenges in the mobile health era, my research has primarily focused on the following aspects: 1) Privacy-by-design Sensing Mechanism: I explore novel sensing mechanisms to directly interrogate desired information and physically isolate privacy, such as mmWave-based vocal sensing, polarized-light-based vasculature sensing. 2) Compression-aware Privacy Computing to tame privacy protection in mobile data heterogeneity and dynamics. 3) Fairness-aware Privacy Computing to solve privacy preservation disparities in mobile health services. In addition, my research innovation has been applied to other mobile health studies, including multi-label neural disease screening, medication adherence detection, and medicine effectiveness assessment for Parkinson's disease self-management.</p><h3 id="eligibility"><b>Bio:</b></h3><p>Huining Li is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, advised by Professor Wenyao Xu.
