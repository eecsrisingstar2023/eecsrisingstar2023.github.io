I specifically focus on how design of online platforms helps, or hurts, connection to oneself and others. 

In particular, my work has shown that specific elements of social media design, such as infinite feeds, can lead to increased normative dissociation, which may facilitate social media addiction. Normative dissociation is intense absorption that disconnects people from normal awareness of their environment, and suspends self-reflection. 

I also study how communication platform design helps and hinders users as they engage in difficult discussions. Currently, I'm building a messaging app that allows people to pause and return to messages when they need a break and don't want to leave someone "on read." My work draws from a variety of disciplines, including HCI, psychology, and critical theory. My research has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, NPR, and Scientific American.</p><h3 id="eligibility"><b>Bio:</b></h3><p>I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Alexis Hiniker. My expected graduation date is Spring 2024. Previously, I worked as a UX Researcher at AI2, studying how users navigate Semantic Scholar. Before that, I spent two years working at Google, and I returned recently as a Research Intern. I'm originally from Florida, where I went to the University of Miami and did a lot of scuba diving. When I'm not working, I really enjoy surfing, hiking, yoga, and listening to Taylor Swift. I am looking for postdocs starting in 2024, and would love to connect with current postdocs about your experiences!</p></div></section></main>
